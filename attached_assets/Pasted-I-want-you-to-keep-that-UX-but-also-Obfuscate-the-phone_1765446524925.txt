I want you to keep that UX, but also:

Obfuscate the phone number in the frontend JSON/data, so it’s not just a plain string like "phone": "(651) 388-7000" that a simple scraper can read.

Add basic rate limiting on the client side so a single user/browser can’t reveal a huge number of phone numbers in a short time.

Keep the site fully static – no backend or serverless functions. All logic must be in the frontend.

Current Setup (assume something like this):

There is a providers.json or a JS file with an array of provider objects such as:

{
  "id": 6,
  "name": "River Valley Lawnscape",
  "city": "Red Wing",
  "phone": "(651) 388-7000",
  "residential": true,
  "commercial": true
}


The UI renders provider cards and shows a “Hold to Reveal Phone” button.

Currently, the phone is likely stored in clear text, and the press-and-hold behavior just toggles visibility.

What I want you to implement:
1. Obfuscate phone numbers in the data

Change the representation of phone numbers so they are not stored as plain text in the JSON. For example, you can:

Store them as a simple encoded string, like base64 or a character code offset, e.g.:

"phoneEncoded": "KDY1MSkgMzg4LTcwMDA="   // base64 of "(651) 388-7000"


or something like:

"phoneChunks": ["KDY1MSkgMzg4LQ==", "NzAwMA=="]


Do not store the clear-text phone number anywhere in the JSON.

Implement a small JS function on the frontend that decodes this format back into a usable phone string only when the user successfully completes the press-and-hold interaction.

The decoding logic should be:

Defined in a separate function, e.g. decodePhone(provider) in script.js.

Not super “high security” (I know this is still client-side), but at least not trivial for a dumb scraper that just reads the JSON.

2. Press-and-hold interaction (keep, but refactor)

I want to keep the current UX: users must press and hold on the “Reveal Phone” button for ~1–1.5 seconds before the phone number appears.

Implement (or refactor) something like this:

Each provider card has a button: "Press and hold to reveal phone".

On mousedown / touchstart, start a timer.

If the user keeps holding for a defined threshold (e.g. 1200ms), then:

Check the rate limit (see below).

If allowed, decode and display the phone number and replace the button text with the actual phone (or show it beside the button).

If they release early (mouseup / mouseleave / touchend / touchcancel), cancel the timer and do not reveal.

Please implement this in a reusable way, e.g. a function like setupHoldToReveal(buttonElement, provider) that wires all events.

3. Client-side rate limiting for reveals

Add a simple rate limiting mechanism in JS to prevent abuse:

Use localStorage to track:

revealCount = number of reveals in a time window.

revealWindowStart = timestamp (ms) when the current window started.

Define a small policy, for example:

Max 10 phone reveals per 10 minutes per browser.

(You can choose sensible constants and keep them easy to tweak.)

Algorithm outline:

On each successful long press (before decoding):

Get now = Date.now().

If there is no revealWindowStart in localStorage, initialize it to now and revealCount to 0.

If now - revealWindowStart > windowDurationMs (e.g. 10 * 60 * 1000), reset:

revealWindowStart = now

revealCount = 0

If revealCount >= MAX_REVEALS_PER_WINDOW, deny the reveal:

Show a friendly message like:

“You’ve revealed the maximum number of provider phone numbers for now. Please try again later.”

Do not decode or show the phone number.

Otherwise, increment revealCount and allow the reveal.

All of this must be purely client-side, no backend.

Make the rate limit code modular, e.g.:

const PHONE_REVEAL_LIMIT = 10;
const PHONE_REVEAL_WINDOW_MS = 10 * 60 * 1000; // 10 minutes

function canRevealPhone() { ... }
function recordPhoneReveal() { ... }


Use these inside the long-press logic.

4. Visual cues

When the phone number is revealed:

Show it in a way that’s still easy to use:

e.g., replace the button text with the phone number and optionally a “Tap to Call” link using tel: URL.

If reveal is blocked by rate limit, show a small tooltip or inline text on the card explaining the limit.

5. Integration details

Please:

Update the provider data format (JSON or JS file) with encoded phone fields for a few existing sample providers.

Update the rendering code so it uses phoneEncoded or similar instead of phone.

Implement and wire the press-and-hold logic with the new decoding + rate limit.

Keep everything working in a single-page static app style, compatible with Netlify static hosting.

You do not need to introduce a bundler or framework if I’m already using plain JS; if you see I’m using React or something else in the Replit project, adapt accordingly, but keep it as simple and readable as possible.
