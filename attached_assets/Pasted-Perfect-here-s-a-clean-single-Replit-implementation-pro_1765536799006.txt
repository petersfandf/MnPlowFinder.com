Perfect — here’s a clean, single Replit implementation prompt that captures the best option based on everything you’ve already built and learned, without undoing good work.

This prompt assumes:
	•	Static SPA (Vite + React)
	•	GitHub Pages deployment
	•	Sitemap + robots already automated
	•	Provider data driven from JSON
	•	You now want canonical, short, shareable URLs that work with or without trailing slashes and don’t hurt SEO

✅ Replit Prompt: Canonical Short URLs + Trailing Slash Handling (Best Option)

Context for Replit

This is a static React SPA built with Vite and deployed to GitHub Pages.
The site already has:
	•	Automated sitemap.xml + robots.txt
	•	Dynamic provider pages
	•	City landing pages
	•	SPA routing via 404.html fallback

We want to finalize URL structure using SEO best practices without adding a backend.

⸻

🎯 Goals
	1.	Support clean short URLs for providers
Example:
	•	/glander-excavating
	•	/reshine-services-llc
	2.	Keep canonical long URLs for SEO
Example:
	•	/provider/13/glander-excavating
	3.	Ensure all URLs work with or without trailing slash
	•	/lake-city ✅
	•	/lake-city/ ✅
	•	/glander-excavating ✅
	•	/glander-excavating/ ✅
	4.	Prevent duplicate SEO penalties
	•	One canonical URL per page
	•	Short URLs are redirects (or canonicalized)

🧠 Implementation Requirements

1. Routing Strategy (Frontend Only)
	•	Add a lookup map at runtime:
	•	slug → providerId
	•	When route matches /:slug:
	•	If slug matches a provider:
	•	Render the provider page
	•	Set <link rel="canonical"> to /provider/:id/:slug
	•	If slug does not match:
	•	Fall back to existing routes (city pages, etc.)

2. Canonical URL Enforcement

For every provider page:

<link rel="canonical" href="https://mnplowfinder.com/provider/{id}/{slug}" />

This ensures:
	•	Google indexes only one URL
	•	Short URLs are safe for sharing
	•	No SEO dilution

3. Trailing Slash Normalization

Implement a small utility that:
	•	Normalizes paths internally by trimming trailing /
	•	Does NOT force browser redirects (static host safe)
	•	Ensures React Router matches both

Example logic:

const normalizedPath = location.pathname.replace(/\/$/, '');

Use this before route matching.

4. Sitemap Rules
	•	Sitemap should include ONLY canonical URLs
	•	/provider/{id}/{slug}
	•	/lake-city
	•	/red-wing
	•	❌ Do not include short URLs (/glander-excavating) in sitemap

Short URLs are:
	•	For humans
	•	Not for indexing

5. SEO Component Update

Ensure the SEO component:
	•	Dynamically sets:
	•	document.title
	•	meta[name="description"]
	•	link[rel="canonical"]
	•	Works for:
	•	Home
	•	City pages
	•	Provider pages
	•	Short URL provider routes

⸻

🧪 Acceptance Tests

Replit should verify:
	•	Visiting /glander-excavating renders correct provider
	•	Visiting /glander-excavating/ also works
	•	Visiting /provider/13/glander-excavating works
	•	Canonical always points to /provider/13/glander-excavating
	•	Sitemap contains only canonical URLs
	•	No duplicate titles or descriptions across providers

⸻

🟢 Why This Is the Best Option
	•	✅ Zero backend
	•	✅ Static-host compatible
	•	✅ SEO-safe
	•	✅ Human-friendly URLs
	•	✅ Shareable links for Facebook / SMS
	•	✅ Scales cleanly as providers grow

⸻

If you want, next we can:
	•	Add city-based short URLs (/snow-removal-lake-city)
	•	Add JSON-LD LocalBusiness schema per provider
	•	Add “Featured Provider” monetization hooks that don’t hurt SEO

You’re building this the right way.
