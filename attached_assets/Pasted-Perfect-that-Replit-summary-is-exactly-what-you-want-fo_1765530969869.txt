Perfect — that Replit summary is exactly what you want for a React/Vite SPA on GitHub Pages. Now let’s “lock it in” and make sure Google can crawl/index it cleanly and you’re not accidentally blocking anything.

1) Sitemap + robots.txt: what they should contain (for your setup)

client/public/robots.txt

Keep it simple:

User-agent: *
Allow: /

Sitemap: https://mnplowfinder.com/sitemap.xml

That’s it. Don’t add disallows unless you have private/admin URLs (you don’t, since it’s static).

client/public/sitemap.xml

For an SPA, it’s correct to list your “real URLs” even though they’re rendered client-side. You already have:
	•	/
	•	/about
	•	/partner
	•	/lake-city /red-wing /wabasha /rochester
	•	/provider/{id}/{slug} (15 of them)

That’s the right approach.

Two tweaks I recommend for SEO quality:
	•	Use <lastmod> (you’re already doing this)
	•	Add <changefreq> + <priority> optionally (Google mostly ignores these, but harmless)

Also, make sure every <loc> is https://mnplowfinder.com/… (not the github.io hostname).

2) The one SPA-specific SEO risk (and how to mitigate it)

Google can index SPAs, but for small local directories it’s better if each URL has meaningful HTML at first load (server-rendered). Since you’re staying static only, you can still improve your odds:

Add unique <title> + <meta description> per route

Right now, your index.html has a good default title/description. But your provider pages and city pages should ideally swap these dynamically.

Best lightweight solution: use react-helmet-async.
	•	City page: “Snow Removal in Lake City, MN | MN Plow Finder”
	•	Provider page: “ReShine Services LLC | Snow Removal in Lake City, MN”

Google will often pick these up even in SPAs.

3) Google Search Console setup (do this order)
	1.	Make sure these URLs load publicly:

	•	https://mnplowfinder.com/robots.txt
	•	https://mnplowfinder.com/sitemap.xml
	•	https://mnplowfinder.com/lake-city (should load, not a hard 404 page)

	2.	Search Console → Add Property

	•	Choose Domain if you can add DNS TXT records easily (best)
	•	Otherwise URL prefix is fine (quick)

	3.	Submit the sitemap

	•	In Search Console: Indexing → Sitemaps → Add a new sitemap
	•	Enter: sitemap.xml

	4.	Request indexing for key pages

	•	Use the URL Inspection tool:
	•	/
	•	one city page
	•	one provider page
Request indexing on those so Google “discovers the pattern.”

4) “How do I get attention?” for a tiny local directory

The fastest, most reliable early wins:
	•	Get backlinks from local sources (these matter a lot)
	•	Red Wing Chamber / Lake City Chamber directory listing for your site
	•	Local Facebook groups (post + ask admins to pin)
	•	Local city/community sites, Nextdoor, local subreddits
	•	Provider backlinks
	•	When providers “claim” their listing, ask them to add “Find us on MNPlowFinder” on their Facebook page or website.
	•	Create 4–8 “city landing pages” that are genuinely useful
	•	Each one should have 150–300 words of unique content (not boilerplate)
	•	Examples: typical snowfall, when to call, driveway vs sidewalk, salting notes, how to choose insured provider, etc.

5) If you want, paste these and I’ll sanity-check them

No need for your whole repo. Just paste:
	•	client/public/robots.txt
	•	client/public/sitemap.xml
	•	your Replit-generated URL list (or the city + provider slug patterns)

…and I’ll tell you if anything is missing or risky.

Also: your Replit inventory says 22 URLs. If you add providers often, your generator script is the right move — just make sure it runs on every build/deploy so the sitemap stays current.
