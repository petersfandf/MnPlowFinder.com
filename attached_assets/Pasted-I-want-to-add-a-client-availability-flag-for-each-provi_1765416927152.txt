I want to add a client availability flag for each provider, driven by the JSON data and controllable from the “Add a Business” form.

1. Data model & JSON changes

In whatever shared type/interface is used for providers (e.g. Provider, Business, etc.), add a new field:

// New field – availability status
availabilityStatus?: 'closed' | 'accepting' | 'limited' | 'waitlist';


Behavior:

Default should effectively be no flag for all existing providers.

For any provider object that does not have availabilityStatus defined, treat it as 'closed' internally.

Only "accepting" should show an eye-catching indicator on the listing cards.

Update the JSON seed file that contains provider data (the one with id, name, city, etc.) so it supports this new property.

Don’t change existing entries yet; keep them without availabilityStatus so we can see the default behavior.

Add an example provider with "availabilityStatus": "accepting" so I can confirm the UI works.

2. Add-a-Business form (new field)

In the “Add Your Business” / “Add Listing” form:

Add a new dropdown field:

Label: Client availability

Name/key should map to availabilityStatus.

Options (value → label):

accepting → Accepting new clients

limited → Limited openings

waitlist → Waitlist only

closed → Season full / not accepting

Default selected value in the form should be closed.

Make sure this value is saved all the way through:

React form state

Any API route / server handler that creates the provider

The stored provider object now includes availabilityStatus.

3. Display on listing cards

On each provider card on the main MN Plow Finder results page:

If availabilityStatus === 'accepting', show an eye-catching badge near the top of the card (under the provider name, or near the rating) such as:

<span class="availability-badge availability-accepting">
  ✅ Accepting new clients
</span>


If availabilityStatus === 'limited', show a more subtle badge, e.g.:

<span class="availability-badge availability-limited">
  ⚠️ Limited openings
</span>


If availabilityStatus === 'waitlist', show:

<span class="availability-badge availability-waitlist">
  ⏳ Waitlist only
</span>


If availabilityStatus is closed or undefined, do not show any badge at all (this is the “no flag” default).

4. Styling

Add minimal CSS/utility classes so the “Accepting new clients” badge is visually prominent:

Distinct background and bold text for .availability-accepting

Slightly toned-down styles for .availability-limited and .availability-waitlist

Small rounded pill look so it fits nicely on the card

You don’t need to redesign the layout — just integrate the badge cleanly with the existing card design.

5. Sanity checks

Ensure TypeScript doesn’t complain anywhere availabilityStatus is accessed.

Make sure server and client code both accept the new field without breaking existing data.

Confirm:

Existing providers (without the new field) display no badge.

A test provider with "availabilityStatus": "accepting" shows the green “Accepting new clients” badge.

Please implement all of this in the current MN Plow Finder project.
