I’m building mnplowfinder.com, a directory for snow removal providers in Southeast Minnesota.
The site is static (hosted on Netlify) and currently has:
– A hero section with search
– Cards for each provider
– A “Own a snow removal business?” form / CTA
– A footer

I now have two email aliases I want to wire into the site:

info@mnplowfinder.com – for residents/general contact.

providers@mnplowfinder.com – for snow providers, business claims, and OEM/technology partners.

Please update the code as follows:

Footer contact

In the footer, add a small “Contact” line that uses mailto:info@mnplowfinder.com.

Example text: “General inquiries: info@mnplowfinder.com
”.

“Own a snow removal business?” CTA

The form/button in this section should send an email to providers@mnplowfinder.com.

If it uses a mailto: link, pre-fill the subject line to something like:
subject=New provider interested in listing on MN Plow Finder.

Add a ‘Claim this business’ link on each provider card

Under each provider profile card (near “Call” / “View Details”), add a small text link:
“Claim or update this listing”.

This should use a mailto: link to providers@mnplowfinder.com with a pre-filled subject and body, for example:

Subject: Claim or update listing: [Business Name]

Body template including placeholders for the user to fill in (business name, phone, website, proof of insurance, etc.).

“Partner With Us” page

Create a simple /partner or /partner-with-us page (or section) with copy describing collaboration with:

Rural service providers

Technology/infra companies (connectivity, backup power, etc.)

On this page, use providers@mnplowfinder.com as the main contact, with a clear mailto: link and a button like “Email us at providers@mnplowfinder.com
”.

General ‘About’ / ‘About the Founder’

If there is an “About” modal or section, include both emails:

Residents/general: info@mnplowfinder.com

Providers/partners: providers@mnplowfinder.com

Make sure any existing placeholder emails on the site are replaced with one of these two, based on whether the context is:

Resident/general → info@mnplowfinder.com

Provider/partner/OEM → providers@mnplowfinder.com

Please implement these changes directly in the HTML/JS/React files in this Replit project and show me which files/sections were edited.
