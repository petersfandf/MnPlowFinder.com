You are updating my existing MN Plow Finder directory site (mnplowfinder.com). 

First, inspect the project structure and determine whether it’s plain HTML/CSS/JS, a static site generator, or React. Whatever stack it is, KEEP the existing structure and styling system, and implement the following changes in the most idiomatic way for this codebase.

GOALS
1. Add a small company footer line.
2. Add an “About Us / About the Founder” section or modal and link.
3. Add a “Partner With Us” page and link.
4. Add a “Claim this listing / Claim & Feature” email link under each provider profile so I can verify businesses manually.

DETAILS

A. FOOTER UPDATE
- In the main site footer, add a subtle text line (small font, light gray, no visual clutter):
  “Peters Field & Frontier Enterprises, LLC — Rural Services & Infrastructure Support”
- Place it near the bottom of the footer, aligned with existing footer content.

B. “ABOUT US / ABOUT THE FOUNDER” SECTION
- Add a footer link labeled “About Us” that opens either:
  - a simple modal, OR
  - a dedicated “About” section near the bottom of the homepage (whichever fits this codebase best).
- Content for that section/modal (feel free to polish wording, but keep the facts):

  Title: “About MN Plow Finder”
  Body:
  - “MN Plow Finder is built and maintained by Peters Field & Frontier Enterprises, LLC.”
  - “Founded by Destin Peters, a seasoned engineer with 15 years of experience in advanced product development, the company focuses on practical, boots-on-the-ground solutions for rural communities.”
  - “MN Plow Finder started as a simple way to help Southeast Minnesota residents find reliable snow removal — but it’s also the first step in a larger rural-service initiative.”
  - “Future service expansions include rural connectivity support, backup power preparation, and home resilience services.”

  Important:
  - DO NOT mention specific employers like ‘Hearth & Home Technologies’ anywhere.
  - Keep tone professional but friendly.
  - Make sure the modal/section is mobile-friendly.

C. “PARTNER WITH US” PAGE
- Add a small text link in the footer navigation labeled: “Partner With Us”.
- Clicking it should go to a simple, static page (for example: `/partner.html` or `/partner` depending on the framework).
- That page should inherit the same header/footer styling as the rest of the site and include content like:

  Heading: “Partner With Us”
  Paragraphs (polish wording but keep meaning):
  - “We collaborate with rural service providers, technology companies, and infrastructure organizations interested in serving Southeast Minnesota.”
  - “If your company provides connectivity, backup power, environmental management, home infrastructure products, or related services, we welcome conversations about pilot programs and regional partnerships.”
  - “MN Plow Finder is part of a broader effort by Peters Field & Frontier Enterprises, LLC to support rural resilience and quality of life.”

  - Include a simple contact call-to-action:
    “To explore partnerships, email us at petersfieldandfrontier@gmail.com.”

D. “CLAIM THIS LISTING / FEATURE THIS BUSINESS” LINK
- Under each provider profile/card on the directory list, add a small text link or button.
  - Label: “Claim this listing” (and if there is room, you can add smaller text nearby: “or request Featured placement”).
- Clicking this should open the user’s email client via a `mailto:` link.
- The `mailto:` should go to: `petersfieldandfrontier@gmail.com`.
- The subject line should automatically include the business name. For example:
  Subject: “MN Plow Finder – Claim Listing: [Business Name]”
- The email body can be pre-filled with a simple template such as:

  “I would like to claim and/or feature our listing on MN Plow Finder.

  Business Name:
  Contact Name:
  Phone:
  Website:
  Proof of insurance available: Yes / No

  Additional details:”

- Implement this so that the correct business name is inserted dynamically from whatever data source the cards use (JSON, array, database, etc.).
- Make sure the new link looks consistent with the existing UI (small, unobtrusive, but clearly clickable).

E. EMAILS & BACK-OF-HOUSE COMMUNICATION
- Wherever you add contact or partner links, use **petersfieldandfrontier@gmail.com** as the email address (I want to keep continuity through Gmail even if domains change later).
- Do NOT hard-code any other email unless one already exists in the code and is clearly for end users.

F. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
- Don’t break any current styling or layout.
- Keep everything responsive on mobile.
- Use existing CSS classes and patterns where possible instead of creating totally new styles.
- After making changes, ensure there are no console errors and that navigation still works as expected.

Finally, summarize the files you changed and what you changed in each, so I can understand and review the diff easily.
